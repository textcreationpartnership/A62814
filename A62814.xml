         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:37838:3"/>
            <p> Anſwerable hereunto, there hath beene in former ages of the <hi>Church</hi> and are alſo now in theſe latter times, many able and <hi>Orthodox Divines,</hi> whoſe hearty deſire for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have ſtirred them up to write for the advancement of <hi>true Religion,</hi> and the benefit of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that through <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing upon their writings, they might win many ſoules unto <hi>God:</hi> whereby being dead them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they might ſtill ſpeake to thoſe that are alive; that ſo their holy DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTRINE might be tranſmitted, and propagated unto poſterity after them.</p>
            <p>Of which number my ſelfe being one, (although the meaneſt of all the reſt) labouring in the ſame <hi>Vineyard,</hi> have thought it neceſſary to gather one handfull of <hi>Grapes,</hi> and carry them to the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> thereby to increaſe the water of <hi>life,</hi> wherewith to refreſh the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> when ſhe is either ſick, or ſorrowfull.</p>

            <p>And in this Age, there was never greater cauſe for <hi>Spirituall Phyſitians,</hi> to provide reſtoring comfortable <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls,</hi> for ſick, caſt downe, and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>ſoules,</hi> then in theſe preſent deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and calamitous dayes.</p>
            <p>Naturall experiment tacitly tels us, that the ſad expreſſion of woefull cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, can never be welcome to a truly Chriſtian, and ſympathizing heart.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ioab</hi> the <hi>Generall</hi> of <hi>King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> hoaſt knew right well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not ſuffer <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> whom he loved, to carry tydings to <hi>King David</hi> of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> death. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.20.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sword</hi> of the late, domeſtick, unnaturall, and inteſtine <hi>Wars,</hi> hath eaten up many thouſands of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation,</hi> yea, hath ſwiftly ſnatched them away, even as the <hi>Oxe</hi> licketh up the graſſe: ſo great have <hi>Rubens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> beene in our <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſelf alſo having borne <hi>a great
<pb facs="tcp:37838:4"/>ſhare</hi> thereof, almoſt as bitter as <hi>death</hi> it ſelf: For divers of us of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> were impriſoned in one roome in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Kingdome, in which Priſon they all ended their dayes: And about one month after all their <hi>deaths,</hi> my ſelfe onely (and that by way of exchange) eſcaped <hi>alive;</hi> like one of <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers, to declare ſomewhat VIVA VOCE, concerning thoſe that are in their graves.</p>
            <p>And as an Aggravation to my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, I have beene a long time (and ſtill remaine) under <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived both of <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> whereby my ſelfe and family are (at this preſent) deſtitute of the means of ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>So that, the <hi>premiſes</hi> maturely and ſeriouſly conſidered, I thought it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my duty both unto <hi>God</hi> my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and alſo to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> my Spirituall Mother, in this her preſent and ſad condition, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to the world her wofull calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:37838:4"/>together with a <hi>Remedy</hi> for the ſame.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe I doe here humbly preſent unto your <hi>Honours</hi> this enſuing Treatiſe, the which may not unfitly be termed A REMEDY FOR THE WARS. Which through <hi>Gods</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the holy Endeavours, and Religious Practiſes, of thoſe perſons unto whom it ſhall come, there may be a preſent ſurceaſing of theſe bloudy, unnaturall, and inteſtine <hi>Engliſh Wars,</hi> and both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> even ſpeedily and happily enjoy their priſtine condition.</p>
            <p>Many thouſands of us <hi>Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> (ſince theſe troubles aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us) have deeply ſuffered, and ſtill doe, by a ſtupendious kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion in <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> and yet how few there are who in lowlineſſe of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and humbleneſſe of <hi>heart</hi> truly repenting them of all their wickedneſs, ſmite their breaſts, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Jer. 8.6.</p>
            <p>And yet I hope the deep apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:37838:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>of theſe preſent Diſtractions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, doth exerciſe, and that not unworthily, the heads of many that are of great Wiſdome and Policy, to thinke how this diſtracted <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> may againe be re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>If ever we would have a wel-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firme, and permanent <hi>Peace</hi> in this our <hi>Kingdome,</hi> then muſt we ſincerely performe theſe three particular <hi>Duties.</hi>

            <p>At the requeſt and importunity of ſome who are more able (both in gifts of Nature and Learning) then my ſelf, who having had a ſight of this Booke (privately in my Study) before it was fully finiſhed, I was prevailed with to preſent it to the publike view; and at their inſtance being reſolved ſo to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:37838:5"/>I called to mind your Noble Lordſhip, (as in duty I am obliged) who ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, freely and ſpeedily condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to my Enlargement by the way of Exchange when I was in Priſon; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craving the peaceable Paſſage of this my Booke under the ſhelter of your <hi>Honourable Patronage,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;</hi> being well aſſured, that your <hi>Honourable</hi> Name, and <hi>Noble</hi> Aſpect, caſting an approbatious and indulgent eye upon it, have ſuch attractive power in them; as that by vertue thereof, they will ſet ſuch a <hi>ſplendid luſter</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this my <hi>weake Worke,</hi> that thereby as by the efficacy of a <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> the eyes and hearts of many thouſands will be drawne unto it: whereby alſo it may take the deeper impreſſion in their hearts, for the reformation of their lives, and the converſion of their ſoules unto <hi>God,</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> the which (through <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing upon it) may greatly conduce to the glory of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the benefit and comfort of many poore diſquieted ſoules.</p>

            <p>So in like manner, as is here expreſſed, <hi>Davids</hi> delight conſiſted in gathering the children of God together, and his joy was in <hi>the aſſembly of the Saints,</hi> furthering them in the ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>But alas beloved, what have we to doe (in theſe cloudy and darkeſome dayes) with this <hi>Davids</hi> joy?</p>
            <p>Every Naturaliſt will tell us, there is an Antipathie between Joy, and Sorrow; yea, they are as contrary, Heretogeneall, and oppoſite in their operations, as Light, and Darkeneſſe, Peace, and War.</p>
            <p>So that our former late joyfull Comedy, being turned into a preſent dolefull Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how then can we <hi>rejoyce?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſad and great diſaſter which lately hath befallen us, whiſpers in our ears, and tacitely tels us, that we muſt now (for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) ſet our faces <hi>Sion</hi>-way, and with our weeping eyes half blinded with briniſh tears, immitate thoſe ſorrowfull Saints, in this our ſad, dejected, and caſt-downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Yea, woe and alas may we juſtly cry out, the bitter fruits of War in our Land, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the provocation of our cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, from the ſwift ſwords ſharpneſſe, hath turned our former late joyes ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, into preſent bitter ſorrowfull ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>When the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declared the Swords comming upon the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their ſins, He commanded him to ſay, <hi>A Sword, a Sword,

               <hi>It is ſharpened to make a ſore ſlaughter, and it is furbiſhed that it may glitter: How ſhall we rejoyce?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in like manner, our preſent wofull and hearts-convincing condition tacitely tels us, that we have little to do with this Davids <hi>joy,</hi> now in theſe ſad times of War and Sorrow: Can there be joy in our hearts, whilſt there is War in our gates?</p>
            <p>Sackcloth and aſhes becomes us better: <hi>Davids</hi> caſe in the next Pſalme before this ſave one, ſuites better with our condition: where he complaines, <hi>Woe is me that I am

            <p>
               <hi>I labour for Peace, but when I ſpeake unto them thereof, they make ready to battell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe, This perverſe practice of prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons, muſt needs greatly afflict a truely, charitable and Chriſtian-ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing heart, who heartily deſireth, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endeavoureth both for himſelfe and others, to have the bleſſing of Peace.</p>
            <p>The like alſo our Kingly <hi>David</hi> in theſe late times of our wofull War, hath often ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the ſons of Mortals, for a ſpeedy, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, firme, and wel-grounded Peace; not onely for Himſelf, but alſo on the behalfe of many thouſands more of our Engliſh-Natives, yea, even the whole Kingdome: but alas the birth of all thoſe His Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as yet) hath proved abortive.</p>
            <p>Eminent and publique Perſons placed in Authority above others, ought (above all others) to make the Word of God the Rule, and the Glory of God both the Aime and End of all their Actions.</p>
            <p>But woe and alas may we at this day juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out, that too many ſuch perſons of our Engliſh Nation, have of late years wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejected the holy Commandements of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37838:12"/>the righteous Lord, and greedily followed the ſinfull luſts of their owne graceleſſe and wicked hearts, for their Self, Siniſter, and By-ends; whereby utter ruine hath been wrought to the lives of many thouſands that are already dead, and alſo great detriment brought to this Engliſh Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth wherein ſtill we live: to the great grief and prejudice of our Gratious and Dread Soveraigne His Majeſty; and all His wel-affected, obedient, dutifull, and loyal-hearted Party; both in, and alſo of this our divided and diſtracted Kingdome.</p>
            <p>How many thouſands of poor, diſtreſſed, deſtitute, deſolate, diſconſolate Women, and almoſt hunger-ſtarved Children, have often ſubmiſſively Petitioned (and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeverall Ordinances preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly extant on that behalf) with grieved hearts and watry eyes, for ſome relief out of their owne Eſtates wherewith to preſerve their languiſhing lives? But alas their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning hath been to no purpoſe, inſomuch, as that they have not onely been perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily neglected, but alſo ſcornefully rejected.</p>
            <p>Oh that thoſe poor diſtreſſed creatures violent Adverſaries might not too truely be termed, <hi>Viri inexorabiles, inflexibiles, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabiles &amp; immiſericordes, qui nullius precibus flectuntur.</hi>

            <p>The Orders &amp; Ordinances which have been made for the relief of ſuch diſtreſſed perſons are repealed at the pleaſures of the Authors thereof, and thus they practiſe <hi>Penelopes telam retexere, viz.</hi> Doe and undoe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as they apprehend that their ſo doing will conduce to their owne advantage.</p>

            <p>The Scripture tels us, <hi>For the Diviſions of Ruben there were great thoughts of heart;</hi> and for the Diviſions that lately have been among our ſelves, there have been great ſearchings of the heart.</p>
            <p>Searchings indeed, when the Sword point hath been imployed as the Inſtrument, like a bloody inquiſitive revenging Searcher, to rip up the boſome, and to make the ſcrutiny, digging there untill the laſt drop of the heart-blood iſſued: to the great griefe of heart and diſturbance of the peace of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>

            <p>In ſo much, as that not onely many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Vulgar ſort of our Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been lately ſlaine, but alſo many Noble, Worthy and Valiant Champions, who were Loyall hearted Subjects, have (in the behalf of their King, Country, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) willingly expoſed themſelves, not onely to the bloody pangs of uncertaine hazards, receiving dangerous wounds in their Bodies; but alſo to the mercileſſe jawes of cruell Death, whereby they have been deprived of their pretious Lives, in this bloody Engliſh, and unnaturall Quarrell.</p>
            <p>If but a little while we recollect our thoguhts, and imploy them in theſe Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call paſſages, we ſhall coactedly conclude, that we have all juſt cauſe joyntly to pray for the peace of this our <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For liſten either Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, and you ſhall hear not only private whiſperings of Multitudes, who haſtily fled from their lawfull habitations, to eſcape the inraged Violence of outragious Souldiers in their fierce fury; fearfully affrighting their diſconſolate families left behind them, and violently Plundering their lawfull goods unlawfully from them: but alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique complaints of thoſe that have loſt their

            </p>
            <p>Thus Death and Deſolation have (of late) rid tryumphantly through many parts of our Kingdome, and alſo made both viſible and tragicall Expreſſions of their puiſſant and ſucceſſefull Valour and magnanimity, (maugre all malignancy) in their deſperate attempts againſt all their Oppoſers; ſwiftly cutting downe with their fatall ſwords of War, divers of all ſorts from off the face of the Earth, making our pleaſant Engliſh fields to become <hi>Golgotha's,</hi> even <hi>Receptacles for dead mens bones,</hi> and laying their ſlaine bodies in the darke Cell of this ſublunary World low in the duſt.</p>
            <p>So that this wofull War hath produced theſe patheticall Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> That many heavy-hearted Fathers and Mothers have ſorrowed for their Sons, woful-hearted Widdowes have wept for their Husbands, tender-hearted Children have cryed for their Fathers, compaſſionate-hearted Siſters have complained for their Brothers, yea, thouſands have lamented for the loſſe of their loving Friends, Neighbours, Kindred, and Acquaintance; ſo that many thouſands have already loſt their lives in this <hi>inteſtine War,</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian Quarrell.</hi>

            <p> Loe, thus immature Death (<hi>Samſon</hi>-like) hath ſuddenly ſeized upon them, ſpeedily ſurpriſed them, and alſo ſwiftly cut them downe as well young as old, with the fierce and fatall Sword, of cruell, bloody, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe <hi>War;</hi> to the deſtruction of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are dead, and the ruine of many thouſands of poor Widdows and fatherleſſe Children left behind them, that are yet lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing alive.</p>
            <p>Alas then, whoſe heart cannot ſympathize their ſorrows, and bleed at the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their calamity?</p>
            <p>Oh therefore <hi>Tell it not in Gath,

            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> in a time of Peace, when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was as a City at Unity in it ſelf, makes his prayer for Peace, &amp; prayeth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation &amp; continuance of the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church, and would alſo have others fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (with himſelf) in their prayers for the Churches Peace, like the Sea with Surges,

            <p>Oh then, how much more doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us in theſe Diſmall, Diſaſterous, and Dog-dayes of the worlds declining Age, <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe calamitous times of diſcrepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diſſention, to do our beſt endeavours joyntly to the uttermoſt of our power, to prevaile with the God of Heaven, for the ſpeedy removall of theſe our preſent penall Evils from us, that are ſtill remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and lying heavy upon us: For alas, we live (at this day) amongſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe people, who differ too little in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from thoſe generations of Men,

            <p>Beloved, too much do the people with whom we now dwel, reſemble thoſe perſons that are here recited: having their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments blindly infatuated with falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; burning inwardly with the fire of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, againſt thoſe indigent perſons, who are harmleſſe towards them, and helpleſſe to themſelves and others; grinding fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the faces of the poor, eating up the Lords people,

            <p>Thus cruelly dealing with our languiſhing <hi>Lives,</hi> almoſt as deadly as <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. Of all which perverſe paſſages, together with many more, being here (for brevity) omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which might alſo juſtly have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, let all Wiſe, Judicious, Learned and truly Religious perſons cenſure: and God in mercy towards us ſpeedily deliver us out of them all.</p>

               <p>But here before we goe into the Temple with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to pray, this Particle <hi>O</hi> doth as it were tell us, it will not be amiſſe to make a little ſtop in <hi>Solomons</hi> porch: that ſo all the people may flock about us,
<note place="margin">Act. 3.11.</note> as they did about them. And alſo bear us company into the houſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This is that the Pſalmeſt drives at in this Particle, or Interjection <hi>O, O Pray, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p> This Interjection <hi>O,</hi> is like the Cryers O Yes, before ſome weighty Proclamation; or the ringing of a Bell before ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermon; or the ſounding of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, calling the Souldiers together, for to March ſpeedily upon ſome great, weighty, and important ſervice.</p>
               <p>Yea, it may not unfitly be parallel'd to the Hebrew word <hi>Selah;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.2.</note> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a lifting up of the voice, to cauſe us to conſider the ſentence as a matter of great importance.</p>
               <p>Behold, the Prophet here is earneſt and patheticall in his perſwaſion to this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty: his heart breaketh out for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fervent deſire he hath that all good men ſhould joyne with him in this Sacrifice of Prayer, to offer up the calves of their lips unto God; And for the kindling of which holy Devotion, this <hi>O</hi> is as it were the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of the Sanctuary, to blow this Sacred fuell into a flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Pray, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that <hi>David</hi> here intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelf, and to eaſe his owne ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by laying the burthen on the necks of others.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> when his land was afflicted with horrible haile, thunder and lightning; <hi>Pray ye unto the

<note place="margin">Exod. 9.28.</note> and I will let you goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> dealt by <hi>Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who when he was exhorted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>to pray, If perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him;</hi> revolved back the buſineſſe upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and would needs engage him to doe the ſervice for him; <hi>Pray ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Lord for me,
<note place="margin">Acts 8.24.</note> that none of theſe things which ye have ſpoken come upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, <hi>David</hi> meant to be one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany himſelfe, but would not willingly goe alone; And therefore ſaith elſewhere, <hi>O praiſe the Lord with me,

               <p>We have here alſo <hi>Davids</hi> practice, and it is the very ſame leſſon that S. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win the Jews: to them that are under the Law, as though I were under the Law, that I might win them that are under the Law.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To them that are without Law, as though I were without Law, (when I am not without Law as pertaining to God, but am in the Law through Chriſt) that I might win them that are without Law.</hi>

               <p>But this is not all.

               <p>The which contentment, although in this worlds conception it be a deſpicable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet, it is the Bleſſing of Nature, the Salve of Poverty, the Maſter of Sorrow, and the End of Miſery.</p>

               <p>His grace like a cloud ſtill hangs over our heads, but the drops of that cloud deſcend not, unleſſe firſt diſſolved by the breath of our <hi>Prayers.</hi>

               <p>A large Patent, including all good things, whether Temporall, or Spirituall, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whether of this life or that to come, all are theirs.</p>
               <p>But how hold they their Charter now? ſurely the conveyance runs altogether in a ſtile of mercy,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> according to <hi>the riches of his goodneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And according to <hi>the riches of his grace.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Alas there is nothing in us that can intitle us upon merit to the leaſt expreſſion of Gods goodneſſe: our tenure is <hi>ex merâ gratiâ</hi> written and ſealed up unto us in the blood of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>And although we make no Purchaſe of our Chriſtian Eſtate, but receive it by deed of Gift, yet God hath reſerved ſome ſmall <hi>Homage,</hi> or as it were ſome peny-Rent as due unto himſelfe, and that is our <hi>prayers and

               <p>So that we connot claime ſo much as one morſell of Bread without our <hi>Prayers;</hi> and if we are not uncapable of it, yet I am ſure we are unworthy of it,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.16.</note> if we begge it not at his hand, who <hi>opens his hand and fils all things living with plentiouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this cauſe we are taught by our bleſſed Saviour to pray,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> Which Petition we may not thinke to be put into the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> onely for poor men; but even they alſo whoſe barns are full of corne, and have bread laid up in ſtore for many yeares, have as much need to ſupplicate God with this Petition, as the pooreſt man that now liveth upon the face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>If there be any one in this place ſo hard driven through extreame poverty, that he can Vye neceſſity with that poore Widdow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and proteſt in the integrity of his heart as ſhe did, <hi>I have not ſo much as a cake,
<note place="margin">1 King. 17.12.</note> but a handfull of meale in a barrell, and a little oyle in a cruſe, which I am now to dreſſe for me and my ſonne that we may eat it and dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why yet I ſay, the rich man that ſwims in the confluence of all outward good things,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37838:29"/>and knowes no end of his riches, is as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged to begge his daily bread as he. Becauſe <hi>man liveth not onely by bread,
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.4.</note> but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If men be provided of bread, and have not Gods bleſſing on their bread, they are like to fare as ill with bread, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it;</p>
               <p>The <hi>leane kine</hi> may eat up the <hi>fat kine,</hi> and be never the fuller,
<note place="margin">Gen. 41.4.</note> 
                  <hi>we may eat much and not be filled, and drinke our fill and not have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<note place="margin">Hag. 1.6.</note> and cloath our ſelves and not be warme, and earne wages and put them into a broken bagge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all outward things will be nothing beneficiall unto us without Gods Bleſſing upon them, and alſo upon us in the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>True it is indeed that I finde in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mention made of the ſtaffe of bread, by which <hi>Metaphor</hi> I am taught, that bread in its latitude is the prop, fulciament, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our naturall life.</p>
               <p>But withall, we ought to know, that as bread is the ſtaffe of our life, ſo Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is the ſtrength, and as it were the ſtaffe of that ſtaffe.</p>
               <p>And unleſſe his bleſſing reſt upon the meanes of our ſuſtentation, the ſtaffe we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37838:29"/>rely upon, will prove no other then a reed of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that inſtead of ſupporting our bodies, will pierce our hands:</p>
               <p>Or like <hi>Moſes</hi>

               <p>Loe, thus the outward things of this life, if we receive them not rightly, and uſe them holily as God commands us, they <hi>being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the word of God, and by prayer;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.5.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being unto us helpefull and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they will prove hurtfull and prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>Oh then beloved, how great cauſe have we to pray with <hi>David,</hi> that the ſame God that <hi>prepares a Table for us, and make our Cup to overflow,</hi> that he that gives us the ſtaffe of Bread, would alſo give us the ſtaffe of his Bleſſing,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> that <hi>his Rod and his Staffe may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually comfort us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deceive not thy ſelfe whoſoever thou art, to thinke by thine owne induſtry to raiſe thee a fortune without God:</p>
               <p>For it is not he that <hi>riſeth early,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.2.</note> nor goeth late to bed, nor eates the bread of carefulneſſe,</hi> that is in an infallible way to be rich: No, when all is done,
<note place="margin">Prov. 10.22.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37838:30"/>
               <p> A Fortune collected by meere induſtry, and without Gods ſpeciall Bleſſing, ſhall ſhortly melt away, and not have the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of continuance, unleſſe it be obtained by ſuit at his hand, who muſt proſper unto us the worke of our hands.</p>
               <p>It will therefore be good for us to take the advice the bleſſed Spirit of God gives us,
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>I councell thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maieſt be made rich, and white raiment, that thou maieſt be clothed.</hi>

               <p>And now what hath been ſpoken of our eſtate Naturall, is no leſſe true of our eſtate Spirituall; In both it is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich;

               </p>
               <p>Oh then beloved, how needfull it is for us to pray unto <hi>the Father of lights,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> that he from whom <hi>every good and perfect gift doth deſcend,</hi> would open unto us the Miniſters of his word a doore of <hi>utterance,</hi> that may give a free paſſage unto his Goſpell.</p>

               <p>This word <hi>Peace,</hi> although it be but a ſhort word, yet it worthily deſerves our Devotions, and juſtly may beſpeake our Prayers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Peace,</hi> is a word but of one ſillable, yet very pregnant in its ſignification, and may not unfitly be parallel'd to that Cloud which <hi>Elijah's</hi> ſervant ſaw,

               <p>Loe, ſuch is the name of <hi>Peace,</hi> a little Cloud to looke upon, but very full of water; for it conteines in it both the former and the latter raine of Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peace,</hi> may fitly be compared to <hi>Pando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's Box,</hi> for it is (as it were) the Neſt wherein all other good bleſſings are hatch't; yea, the ſumme, complement, and Epitomy of all earthly felicity:</p>

               <p>At which time, Reaſon ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them not to be ſo lulled aſleep, and as it were bewitched with the ſweet and

               </p>
               <p>And thus, all the joy of the field is by the noiſe of Drums, and the neighings of horſes, and the claſhing of Armes, quite dround and deſtroyed; and ſo its mirth is turned into mourning:</p>

               </p>

               <p>So that now we may plainely perceive; all Bleſſings both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as well Divine as ſecular, are wrapt and folded up (as it were) in the boſome and lap of <hi>Peace.</hi>

               <p>And therefore whoſoever thou art that takeſt upon thee the honourable calling of a Souldier, examine thy condition by the word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The juſtice of thy cauſe; the willingneſſe of thy heart; the lawfulneſſe of thy calling: the readineſſe of thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods commands, as to ſtrike when he biddeth, and to forbeare when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.</p>
               <p>Have regard unto this I humbly pray thee; as alſo not to Rob, nor Plunder, nor Kill, nor fight, but againſt a lawfull Enemy: ever remembring, and conſtantly practiſing that Religious exhortation of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               <p>But alas, all Souldiers obſerve not theſe Rules, for many times in the Wars, there is Gaine inſtead of Godlineſſe, Courage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Equity, Blood-thirſtineſſe inſtead of Valour, Policy inſtead of Juſtice; and which is alſo greatly to be lamented, in many Souldiers no Religion: for ſeldome doe they pray till they be in danger of Death: And yet how carefull ought they to be to have grace in their hearts, who carry (as it were) their lives continually in their hands? But O how defective are many of them, of what they ought to be; being full of fierce fury, enraged Violence, cruell Hatred, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed covetouſneſſe, thieviſh Plundering, ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Drunkenneſſe, beaſtly Whoredome, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable Oathes, horrid Blaſphemies, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Curſes, impure Diſcourſes, terrible Threatnings, falſe Accuſations, filthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, &amp;c.

               <p>The over-burdening of this whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with intollerable Taxes.</p>

               <p>For a Man to be in Miſery and not to <hi>Pray;</hi> is an infallible Signe of his <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a man to pray, and not to <hi>humble himſelfe,</hi> is an evident Token of his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</hi>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:37838:53"/>and worldly Stratagems are fled from us, and all our former faſt friends ſhrinkingly from us, have forſaken us, and Death ſtands at our elbowes ready to ſeize upon us; yet ſtill <hi>Prayer</hi> is left with us, as a gracious <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> and an effectuall <hi>Advocate</hi> to intercede for us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And here alſo we muſt remember, that our <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be cordiall if it be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its not the voice, but the vote; not the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall harmony, but the heart that cryeth in the eare of God.</hi>

                  <hi>David Prayed to the Lord when he was in trouble:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 120.1</note> and the Lord heard him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoſhaphat,
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20</note> Prayed to the Lord for helpe againſt the Ammonites, Moabites, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Mount Seir</hi> his enemies that came againſt him to deſtroy him; <hi>And the Lord laid ambuſhments againſt them, and they fought one againſt another, and when the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites, and Moabites had deſtroyed the men of Mount-Seir, then every one helped for to kill each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Iſraelites cryed to the Lord when they were in trouble,

               </p>
               <p>Loe, thus the Lord hath formerly heard the <hi>Prayers</hi> of his ſervants being in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alſo granted their requeſts, for his glory and their comfort: and ſtill he is the ſame God, his hand is not ſhortned.
<note place="margin">Eſay 59.1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore let us not neglect to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> it being the great prevailing Ordinance of God; either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us of falling into troubles, or elſe to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37838:54"/>free us out of them, being fallen into them.</p>
               <p>For the Second, viz. <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have Gods <hi>Querie</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> concerning the Averſion of Gods judgements from <hi>Ahab; Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelfe before me?
<note place="margin">1 King. 21.29.</note> Becauſe he humbleth himſelfe before me, I will not bring the evill in his dayes: but in his ſonnes dayes will I bring the evill upon his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when God (by his Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi>) threatned the <hi>Ninevites, adhuc quadraginta dies, &amp; Nineve ſubvertetur. Yet forty dayes and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, upon their <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> that threatning was reverſed, and the <hi>Nirevites</hi> preſerved. <hi>And God ſaw their workes,
<note place="margin">Iona. 3.10</note> that they turned from their evill waies: and God repented of the evill that he had ſaid, that he would doe unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What? were the ſinfull <hi>Ninevites</hi> ſpared from Deſtruction, through Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them upon their <hi>Humiliation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh then, how ought we in this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and deplorable condition, to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our <hi>Humiliation</hi> with zealous <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 1.4.</note> who when he heard of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> Calamity, <hi>He ſate downe and wept, and mourned certaine dayes, and faſted and prayed before the God of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility,</hi> is the firſt helpefull ſtep, by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37838:54"/>which we aſcend the heavenly Throne of Gods ſacred Majeſty for mercy; and alſo the firſt raiſing Round of Godly <hi>Jacobs</hi> long reaching Ladder, by which, like ſwift An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, our pretious Soules climbe up to God in Heaven, and his holy Angels, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings deſcend downe to us upon earth.</p>
               <p>Loe, thus the moſt great and glorious God, whoſe habitation is in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
<note place="margin">Eſa. 57.15</note> yet alſo vouchſafeth his gratious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to dwell amongſt humble minded men here upon Earth, in the loweſt hearts.</p>
               <p>Therefore, one of the meanes to obtaine mercy, in this our preſent miſery is, in, by, and through <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admit thou canſt not by thy <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> obtaine at the hands of God, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of a Nation from a Generall cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: yet notwithſtanding, thou ſhalt thereby procure for thy ſelfe the <hi>Marke</hi> of the Servant of God.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And although our <hi>Humiliation</hi> be not the cauſe of healing our Lands diſtempers; yet notwithſtanding, it is one of thoſe meanes which God hath ordained for procuring the Cure thereof: and therefore it muſt not be neglected by us; for, God hath commanded us to uſe the meanes to attaine the end.</p>
               <p>And uſing the meanes as we ought, there
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37838:55"/>will be no cauſe for us to doubt, of Gods bleſſing upon them.</p>
               <p>Deſpaire not then of helpe in thy greateſt dejection, for there is yet <hi>Balme in Gilead,</hi> and <hi>Hope in England:</hi> And as <hi>Shechaniah</hi> once ſaid unto <hi>Ezra</hi> in another caſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet now there is Hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 10.2</note> The which I hope may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be applyed to us <hi>Engliſh Natives</hi> in theſe many, preſent, and great diſtractions amongſt us: For God is more mercifull, then we have been ſinfull, if we can be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrowfull.</p>
               <p>And for the proofe hereof, I will declare unto you two examples in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The one in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the other in the time of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſhall be that of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the King of <hi>Judah;</hi> He was a notorious Malignant againſt the Lord, He committed many horrible and hainous abominations, wherewith the Lord was wrathfully diſpleaſed againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhed ſo much innocent blood, till he had filled Jeruſalem from one end to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore the Lord brought upon him and his people,
<note place="margin">2 King. 21.16.</note> the Captaines of the Hoaſt of the King of Aſhur, which tooke Manaſheh, and put him in fetters, and bound him in Chains, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37838:55"/>carried him to Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when he was in tribulation he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord his God, and humbled himſelfe greatly before the God of his Fathers, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him: and God was intreated of him, and heard his prayer, and brought him againe to Jeruſalem into his Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, what although thou haſt former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen into ſinne, and thereby greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord to wrath againſt thee? yet notwithſtanding, now at the laſt returne unto God, and humble thy ſelfe before him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cast downe thy ſelfe before the Lord,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.17</note> and he will lift thee up: he will not deſpiſe the Sacrifice of a ſorrowfull ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will not reject the ſighing <hi>of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 66.22</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He will dwell with thre,

<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4.</note> and love thee freely, and turne away his anger from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And for a Goſpel-patterne hereof,
<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> looke upon the Parable of the Prodigall.</p>
               <p>Who by his riotous living greatly grieved the tender heart of his loving Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo he vexatiouſly provoked him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt him: yet notwithſtanding, when in <hi>Humility</hi> he returned unto his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and angry Father; Loe then, His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received him joyfully, imbraced him lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly

               </p>
               <p>And for the third, viz. <hi>Caſting away all our Tranſgreſſions.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Oh then, let us all in Gods feare, take heed of our Serpentine <hi>Delilahs,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the ſweete meat of Sinne, muſt have the ſower ſauce of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſpake of the death of his body,

               <p>So in like manner, the exerciſing of thy ſweet-darling-ſinne, though never ſo little, and living and dying in it (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) will be the everlaſting deſtruction of thy ſoule.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, the terrible ſword of Gods juſtice againſt us for our ſinnes, will ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the <hi>Wars</hi> in our gates.</p>

               </p>

               <p>We lye under the preſſure of an heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that which makes the Burthen the more intollerable is, That <hi>it is not an open enemy that hath done us this diſhonour, for then we ſhould have borne it:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>But woe and alas, this is now our wofull Condition, that thoſe who formerly have lived friendly, now altogether voide of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſheath their ſwords into each

               <p>Beloved, as you deſire to Preſerve your Selves, your Lives, your Wives, your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, your Brethren and Companions, your Cattell and Subſtance, yea, and the whole Kingdome from Deſtruction, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe the meanes delivered.</p>
               <p>But alas, the <hi>Meanes</hi> here preſcribed, is by many too much neglected, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary too fluently, and frequently practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I doe heartily wiſh on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and for the welfare of our <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> that there may never be juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them, the Lords complaint againſt the Obſtinate <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in that day did the Lord God of Hoaſts call unto weeping and mourning,

               </p>

                  <hi>And behold, joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine, eating and drinking, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I greatly feare, there are too many thouſands (at this day) in <hi>England,</hi> that are foully faulty herein, and deeply guilty hereof: who little, or nothing at all lay to heart, the wofull miſeries of theſe preſent ſad and calamitous times: never calling
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37838:66"/>their ſinnes to minde, and ſmiting their breaſts, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi>

               <p>Now the three Salves that I have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the Curing of theſe Sores, <hi>viz. Prayer, Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>caſting away all our Tranſgreſſions,</hi> are all ſummed up, (By the bleſſed Spirit of God) in the former part of one verſe in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I ſhut the heaven that there be no raine,
<note place="margin">Chron. 7.13, 14.</note> or if I command the graſhopper to devour the land, or if I ſend peſtilence amongst my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If my people, among whom my name is called upon, doe humble themſelves, and pray; and ſeek my preſence, and turne from their wicked wayes: Then will I hear in heaven, and be

               </p>
               <p>So that, if we performe theſe three things, then the Lord hath promiſed, that he will <hi>heare us, and help us, and heale us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus beloved, if carefully and faithfully we uſe the <hi>Meanes</hi> here preſcribed, we ſhall certainly have Gods bleſſing upon our endeavours therein, as he hath promiſed: whereby our ſorrow will be turned into joy, our mourning into mirth, and our <hi>Warres</hi> into <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh then let us ſpeedily put in practice the Prophet <hi>Hoſeas</hi> exhortation to the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>And let us heartily ſend up our Prayers into Heaven for the Remnant that is left.</p>
               <p>Be unceſſant Suiters to the Lord for <hi>Peace:</hi> Let me intreat you all in the bowels of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to make your approaches to the beautifull Gate of Gods mercy, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the God of <hi>Peace,</hi> even for his deare ſake who is the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to looke once againe with his eye of pitty &amp; compaſſion, upon the <hi>diſtreſſed eſtate</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi>

               <p>So that, if we would have <hi>God</hi> for our <hi>Father,</hi> we muſt account the <hi>Church</hi> for our <hi>Mother,</hi> and procure her <hi>Peace</hi> with our beſt endeavours, and there is no more prevalent way for us to helpe her, then by praying heartily to God for her.</p>

               <p>Hereupon the poore Innocents were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and ſome of them clad with skins of wilde beaſts, were torne in pieces by dogs.</p>
               <p>And others caſt one upon another, untill they became great heaps, after the manner of <hi>Bone-fires,</hi> and then fire put to them, and their bones burning ſerved for light in the night, in the ſtead of <hi>Torches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at the laſt this wicked wretch, the cauſer of all that cruelty exerciſed upon the poore Chriſtians, ſeeing himſelfe in danger to be murthered, by one appointed for that purpoſe, (as a juſt reward for his horrible, unjuſt, and inhumane dealing) haſtned his owne death by killing himſelfe, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> reporteth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>We reade in Hiſtory of one <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a <hi>Deacon</hi> of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> ſcituate neare to <hi>Lyba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who lived under the Empire of <hi>Julian the Apoſtate,</hi> and came to a miſerable end.</p>
               <p>For after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was deceaſed, by whoſe authority the holy Martyr had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe many of their Images and Idols, the abominable Idolaters did not onely
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37838:82"/>murther him, but alſo devoured his liver with bread, as if it had beene the ſweeteſt morſell of meat in the world.</p>
               <p>But the all-ſeeing eye of Almighty God beholding their villany, his revengfull rod bruiſed them to pieces.</p>
               <p>For their teeth wherewith they chewed that unnaturall food fell out of all their heads; and their tongues wherewith they taſted it, rotted and conſumed to nothing; and laſtly, their eyes which beheld it, failed them, and they became all blinde.</p>
               <p>Loe thus were they all ſerved, bearing juſtly the markes of Gods indignation, for ſo horrible, inhumane and unnaturall Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reporteth, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valerian</hi> the Emperour, was a deadly Enemy to the profeſſors of <hi>Religion,</hi> and very terribly perſecuted them in his Dominions.</p>
               <p>But ſhortly after, himſelfe was taken priſoner in the <hi>Perſian Warres,</hi> being Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten yeares of age, and was made a ſlave to his Conquerour all the reſt of his life.</p>
               <p>And whoſe condition was ſo miſerable, that <hi>Sapor,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> uſed his back as a block or ſtirrop to mount upon his Horſe, and at the laſt, to make up the full number of his miſeries, he cauſed his Skinne to be taken from his Fleſh,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37838:83"/>whilſt he was alive, and then poudred him with ſalt, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reporteth, in his <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hiſtory. Booke</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>The cruell, mercileſſe, and hard-hearted <hi>Jewes,</hi> did perſecute even unto the death, the innocent Lambe of God, who is the Lord of life, our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But did they eſcape Puniſhment? Verily no, for the avenging hand of the Juſt-puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, ſinne-revenging God, followed after them, overtooke them and ſeized upon them to their Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>For they were driven up and downe, from place to place in diverſe Countries by the <hi>Deputies:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after that, there were ſlaine of them at <hi>Ceſaria</hi> in one day Twenty thouſand:</p>
               <p>At <hi>Alexandria</hi> another time Fiftythouſand.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Joppa</hi> Eight thouſand and Foure hundred, beſides the burning of both the Townes:</p>
               <p>At <hi>Damaſcus</hi> Ten thouſand had their throats cut:</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Jewes</hi> that were in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they were pinched with ſo ſore a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as that they did eate the excrements of Oxen; and many women were conſtrained to boile and to eate their owne Children.</p>
               <p>And in that great extremity many thinking to ſave their lives by flying to the Enemy;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37838:83"/>were taken and ſlit in pieces, in hope to finde gold and ſilver in their bowells:</p>
               <p>And at the laſt the whole <hi>City</hi> was taken by force &amp; the holy <hi>Temple</hi> conſumed by fire.</p>
               <p>And this in generall was the miſerable iſſue of that lamentable <hi>Warre:</hi> during which time, Fourſcore &amp; ſeventeene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Jewes</hi> were taken Priſoners, and Eleven hundred thouſand ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Some of the Priſoners were carried re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully into <hi>Rome;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others were murthered at their <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> wills;</p>
               <p>Some were torne in pieces and devoured of wilde Beaſts:</p>
               <p>Others were conſtrained to march in Troupes againſt their Fellowes, and kill one another as if they had beene Enemies.</p>
               <p>And the Remnant of that wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which remained alive, after the mighty tempeſt of Gods Wrath was paſt, were diſperſed and ſcattered abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Nations under Heaven:</p>
               <p>So that their condition (at this day) is ſo vile and contemptible, as that no Nation under Heaven is halfe ſo miſerable: which is a manifeſt evidence of Gods vengeance ſtill abiding upon them.—As <hi>Joſephus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his bookes of the <hi>Jewiſh Warres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I might alſo be very copious in

               </p>
               <p>The Earth (of it ſelfe) will bring forth little elſe but briers and weedes if it be not tilled, and Vines will wax wilde if they be not pruned: Even ſo, the corrupt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Affections of our graceleſſe and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hearts,</hi> like pernitious <hi>Briers</hi> and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Weeds,</hi> would quickly over-runne, not onely all the Parts and Members of our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> but alſo all the Powers and Faculties of our <hi>Soules,</hi> if our <hi>Gracious God</hi> by his tender Care over us, loving Chaſtiſements upon us, and powerfull working of his bleſſed Spirit in us, ſhould not effectually <hi>Purge, Dreſſe,</hi> and <hi>Manure</hi> us.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Unto which I anſwer with the wordes of <hi>Salomon, There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the end thereof are the waies of death,</hi> Prov. 14.12.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37838:131"/>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> tells us, <hi>that no man knoweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love or hatred, of all that is before him, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1.

               <p>And therefore, let no ſuch blinde infatuated Perſons, being miſ-guided by their erroneous Conceptions, falſly flatter themſelves with any ſuch fallacious Conceits, of being in <hi>Gods</hi> favour, becauſe their actions (for the preſent) are proſperous; for they can never comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably aſſure themſelves of <hi>Gods</hi> gracious Love and ſpeciall Favour towards them, (though never ſo proſperous in their Deſignes) unleſſe they have his feare before their eyes, which teacheth them to abſtaine from the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and to depart from the practice of all <hi>Impiety,</hi> which none of thoſe either doe, or can doe, ſo long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ſinfull perpetration of horrid <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for a ſpirituall <hi>Salve</hi> wherewith to cure this carnall <hi>Infirmity,</hi> I doe referre all ſuch deluded and ſelfe-deceiving Perſons (for their farther and fuller Convincement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) wandering in the foggie Miſts of blinde Ignorance and dangerous Errours, to that cleere and infallible light of Truth which the holy Scripture (by way of Collection) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37838:132"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That every ſucceſsfull and proſperous military <hi>Action</hi> which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>God</hi> permits, is not juſtifiable in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> from the <hi>Actors</hi> thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>God</hi> himſelfe commands it to be done.</p>
               <p>Loe! this Truth evidently appeareth unto us, in the military Practiſes of <hi>Jehu</hi> that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, Couragious, and Kingly <hi>Captaine,</hi> who exceedingly proſpered in his War-like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and did great Execution upon divers Malefactors, and that alſo by <hi>Gods</hi> owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and yet notwithſtanding, even <hi>Jehu</hi> himſelfe muſt be accounted as a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> for his heart was not ſincere in the ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> he was a Selfe-ſeeker and Selfe-ſerver, aiming at his owne Ends, and not at the Glory of <hi>God:</hi> and therefore <hi>God</hi> threatned to <hi>viſit the blood of Izreel upon the houſe of Jehu,</hi> Hoſ. 1.4. What <hi>Jehu?</hi> That proſperous, Valiant, and victorious Conquerour? Muſt <hi>He</hi> who did ſo much military Service, and that alſo by <hi>Gods</hi> owne Injunctions, and expreſſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Muſt <hi>He</hi> (I ſay) be accounted as a Murtherer in the ſight of <hi>God?</hi> yea, even <hi>Jehu</hi> himſelfe muſt be reputed guilty of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Poſterity muſt be reſponſible and ſuffer for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And therefore deceive not thy ſelfe with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37838:132"/>the falſe Conception of war-like Proſperity, for proſperous Succeſſes in Military Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not always infallible <hi>Arguments</hi> of the Favour of <hi>God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſiah.</note> for one man may periſh in them, and yet be in <hi>Gods</hi> Favour; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man may proſper in them,
<note place="margin">Jehu.</note> and yet be in <hi>Gods</hi> Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>The proſperous Succeſſe which ſome wicked men have in their evil Actions, doth <hi>Dadulus</hi>-like make them Wings, whereby they will mount ſo high towards the Sun, untill the heat of <hi>God</hi>'s juſt Anger ſhall melt the Wax which holds the feathers thereof together, and then themſelves <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>-like muſt fall down into the deep Sea of <hi>God</hi>'s Diſpleaſuer, to their deadly Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Proſperous Succeſſe in evil Actions, makes wicked men think that they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on as the Sun, Moon, and Stars are, without any reſtraining Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Yea, as long as there is a prevailing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient,</hi> the which with proſperous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe anſwereth the Expectation of wicked men in their ungodly Enterpriſes; ſo long they will endeavour to make all thoſe their evil Actions juſtifiable, becauſe (for the preſent) they ſerve their turn, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their own carnal Contentment: and will continue muſtering up their Forces
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37838:133"/>marching ſtill forward, and <hi>John</hi>-like driving on furiouſly in their peſtilent, pernicious and perverſe paths of rebellious <hi>Impiety,</hi> though (at the laſt) their ſo doing ſhould prove to the Deſtruction of themſelves, and many others.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Logician</hi> will rationally tell us, that the <hi>Conſequence</hi> will neceſſarily follow its undoubted <hi>Premiſes;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence then,

               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever ſhall rebelliouſly take up Armes,

               <p> And farther alſo, as by <hi>Philoſophy</hi> we learn, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is the Originall <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all <hi>Motion</hi> in Man; lame and impotent <hi>Motion</hi> onely excepted: the which proceedeth from another <hi>Cauſe;</hi> viz. ſome defect in the <hi>Body.</hi> Even ſo, by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> we are taught,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> that <hi>God</hi> is the Life of the <hi>Soul.</hi> And without him, we can have neither <hi>Life,

               </p>
               <p>So that, we may truly collect from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> that, <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Beginner</hi> and firſt <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Motion;</hi> but, not of defective <hi>Motion:</hi> that is from our Selves.

               <p>Hence then we may learn this infallible Point of our Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> without the true Knowledge and right Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, it is not poſſible for us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Purity of Chriſtian Doctrine, in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37838:134"/>divers other Orthodoxall Points of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Religion:</hi> viz. that the mercifull <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Power, in all the good Actions of Godly men, by his <hi>Providence</hi> working; and the juſt <hi>Withdrawment</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from all the evil Actions of Wicked men, by his <hi>Permiſſion</hi> ſuffering: makes clearly for the full <hi>Justification</hi> of the righteous <hi>God,</hi> and the juſt <hi>Condemnation</hi> of unrighteous <hi>Men.</hi> According to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling Complaint of the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s juſt,

               </p>
               <p>And here, (for the farther clearing of this Point, which to many Perſons may ſeem ſomewhat abſtruſe) we are inevitably put in mind of the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> and, ought alſo therein ſeriouſly to conſider, of their joynt <hi>Concurrence</hi> in one and the ſame <hi>Thing,</hi> and ſeverall <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> in particular <hi>Actions:</hi> for, to <hi>Order,</hi> and to <hi>Act,</hi> are two ſeverall <hi>Things,</hi> and may alſo be differently done, by two particular Perſons, in one and the ſame <hi>Action;</hi> and yet the <hi>One,</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the <hi>Other,</hi> either to <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Example,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Decree</hi> doth not enforce <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Will;</hi> but, the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> worketh and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37838:135"/>moveth of it ſelf. Yea, the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> hath in it ſelf the beginning of evil <hi>Motion,</hi> and ſinneth willingly. Therefore, though the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>God</hi> impoſeth a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> upon all ſecondary-<hi>Cauſes,</hi> ſo that, they muſt needs be framed and diſpoſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame; yet, are they not coacted or compelled thereunto: but, are all of them carried with their own voluntary <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that, <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Decree</hi> doth move all ſecondary-<hi>Cauſes,</hi> but, not take away their own proper <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, all ſecondary-<hi>Cauſes,</hi> are ſo moved of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, being the primary-<hi>Mover</hi> of them; as that, he always doth well, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and juſtly, in every one of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Movings,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.17.</note> being righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi> But, the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-<hi>Cauſes</hi> themſelves being moved, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in contrary <hi>Motions,</hi> according to their own <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Frame.</hi> If (therefore) they be <hi>Good,</hi> then they are carried unto that which is <hi>Good:</hi> but, if they be <hi>Evil,</hi> then they are carried unto that which is <hi>Evil.</hi> So that, according to the double beginning of their <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> there is a double and divers <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> performed by them.</p>
               <p>From whence then we may ſafely collect, that the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth not take away
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37838:135"/>the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> or the <hi>Contingency</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but, onely order and diſpoſe it.</p>

               <p>True it is indeed that the tranſlated Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us of <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> yet ought we to be informed, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing caſuall in regard of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but there are many things caſuall in reſpect of <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Ignorance.</hi> So that, we muſt not aſcribe any thing to blind <hi>Fortunes</hi> Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but attribute all unto <hi>God</hi>'s All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Providence; yet ſo, that the Divine
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37838:136"/>Providence doth not take away the Will of <hi>Man,</hi> or the Contingency thereof: for <hi>God</hi> according to the common <hi>Axiome</hi> of the School, <hi>non neceſſitat, ſed facilitat,</hi> he doth induce the Godly to doe good with <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,</hi> not inforce them againſt their Will with the leaſt <hi>Urgency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A plain and pregnant proof we have to this purpoſe, by the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> being (at the firſt) both <hi>Himſelf</hi> &amp; his <hi>Will</hi> made <hi>good;</hi> yet, mutably <hi>good:</hi> for he ſo ſtood, as that he might fall. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of whoſe <hi>Fall</hi> was, the voluntary Inclination of his own <hi>Will</hi> unto Evil. Not that his <hi>Will</hi> was any thing at all forced, or by any Violence of <hi>God</hi>'s Purpoſe compell'd thereunto: but, <hi>Adam</hi> fell of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> without any <hi>Coaction</hi> (at all) from <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, for the better clearing of this Point, we muſt a little farther conſider of <hi>Adam</hi> in firſt <hi>Condition;</hi> to whom <hi>God</hi> gave (at his <hi>Creation</hi>) <hi>Naturam flexibilem, à flexible Nature,</hi> being ſubject to mutation: creating him <hi>in Poteſtate ſtandi, ſeu Poſſe cadendi,</hi> in Power of ſtanding, or Poſſibility of falling. His Power of ſtanding proceeded from <hi>God,</hi> as being his <hi>Creator;</hi> his Poſſibility of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling came from himſelf as being but a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. Con.</note> Whereupon Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Man ex nihilo, of Nothing:</hi> and therefore left in Man a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> to return <hi>in nihilum, into Nothing,</hi> if he tranſgreſſed the Command of his <hi>Maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:37838:136"/>
               <p> And thus, <hi>Man</hi> was even <hi>ab Origine ſuo,</hi> from his <hi>Creation,</hi> very incident to his <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> The which evidently ſheweth the great Difference between the Omnipotent &amp; Unchangeable <hi>Nature</hi> of the holy <hi>God,</hi> &amp; the Impotent and Inſtable <hi>Condition</hi> of ſinful <hi>Man.</hi> For, it is a <hi>Maxime</hi> in <hi>Divinity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabiliter eſſe bonum, proprium ſolius eſt Dei.

               <p>There was a right Noble and Valiant <hi>Knight,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter could hardly ſurprize <hi>Babylon,</hi> bethought himſelfe of a wonderfull ſtrange practice:</p>

               <p>He went home to his owne houſe, and cauſed his ſervants to rent his whole body all over with whipping him, and alſo to cut off his noſe, his lippes, and his eares: And then ſpeedily running to <hi>Babylon,</hi> in ſuch a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and mortified manner, he made the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> believe, that <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>King</hi> had exerciſed this Cruelty upon him, becauſe he had ſpoken on their behalfe, counſelling him for to breake up his Siege, and to remove his <hi>Army</hi> from aſſaulting their <hi>Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> hearing this report, and the rather thinking it to be true, becauſe they ſaw him ſo ſhamefully diſ-figured in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; were preſently perſwaded for to make him their <hi>Chiefe Captaine.</hi>

               <p>It was reported of <hi>Socrates</hi> that he ſo greatly delighted in <hi>Vertue,</hi> as that no kinde of ſorrow did ever alter his countenance.</p>
               <p>But beloved, the inward <hi>Jubile</hi> of the minde in the Kingdome of <hi>Grace,</hi> doth farre excell his condition: which <hi>ſtandeth not in meate, or drinke, or any other outward things, but in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17.</p>
               <p>The which <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> amongſt the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> hath many honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles given unto it;</p>
               <p>They call it <hi>Agrum beatitudinis: Hortum

               </p>
               <p>So that, I may truly ſay, The <hi>Spirit</hi> of a true <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> being ſound in ſincerity, and ſeconded with a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> is able to beare out all his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, together with all the miſeries incident to his humane Nature: And through the power of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> is able alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the terrours of <hi>Death,</hi> and the fearfullneſſe of the <hi>Grave:</hi> yea, to endure with <hi>a gracious humility,</hi> even the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>holy Angels</hi> at the laſt Judgement Day.</p>
               <p>Whereas, there is no <hi>Peace</hi> to thoſe that are without the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 57. ult</note> continuing in their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>So that, if any one of them had ſtrength in his Limbes tranſcending <hi>Sampſons,</hi> and power in his Bones excelling all the ſonnes of <hi>Anack</hi> united together: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, unleſſe his <hi>Conſcience</hi> be ſeared, he ſhall often heare to his terrour, <hi>an Authenticke Divine condemning Eccho,</hi> ſummoning him to appeare before <hi>Chriſts Tribunall-Barre,</hi> to give an accompt of all his evill thoughts,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37838:154"/>words and workes; the which will ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrifie his bitter, afflicted, and <hi>wounded Conſcience,</hi> as that he ſhall be reſtleſſe, even in the midſt of all his earthly delights, and worldly pleaſures.</p>
               <p>For, unleſſe the Conſciences of ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons are Cauterized, they have often times gripings and gnawings, and horrible convulſions within them, which are as it were certaine flaſhings of the flames of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire unto them, before they come into that place of torment.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> which the true <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have, is ſo comfortable a Cordiall unto them, as that it made the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to rejoyce in their afflictions,
<note place="margin">Act. 5.41.</note> that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for their <hi>Maſters</hi> ſake.</p>
               <p>This was it that made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to ſing in priſon at mid-night.

               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, made holy <hi>Job</hi> more happy <hi>in Stercore,</hi> on the top of a Dunghill, then <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>in Nemore,</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> becauſe, as he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.6. <hi>I will keepe my righteouſneſſe, and will not forſake it: mine heart ſhall not reprove me all my dayes.</hi>
